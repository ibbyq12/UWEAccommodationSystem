# UWE Accommodation System
A system designed for the University of West England to manage accommodation in their accommodation halls. It was created for an Object-Oriented project using Java and JavaFX.

If downloaded as a zip, extract the first "AccommodationProject" folder which is inside of the "UWEAccommodationSystem" folder.

Requirements:
The JavaFX and Java SDK folders should be in your Java folder in C:/Program Files if on Windows.
If needed to change the directory path of Java and JavaFX, change the module path in launch.json to your appropriate path and in settings.json for all of the referenced libraries.
